                    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                    <p>aptTrack has been developed as part of my 3rd year studies
                        at Kingston University, London.</p>
                    <p>Working with a real world client, I have designed and implemented
                        a system which aims to simplify the tracking of tasks and
                        responsibilities in order to enable more convenient
                        prioritisation of activities in the work place.</p>
                    <p>Critical to my project is ensuring that it can handle the
                        quantity of traffic and users that it is designed to 
                        accommodate.</p>
                    <p>I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to help me
                        out simply by having a play with the system. Your doing this
                        will help to greatly increase the number of records in my
                        database, proving that the system is capable of coping.</p>
                    <p>Designed to be responsive to various devices, you will be
                        able to login from your mobile phone, tablet, laptop or
                        desktop computers so explore the features on the bus or
                        during any free time you may have in the near future.</p>
                    <p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
                    <p><strong>Robert</strong></p>

                        <h3>Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Your comments are very important in helping to determine
                            what is great about aptTrack and what needs more work.</p>
                        <p>Lots of time has been spent trying to get it right but
                            without feedback from users, it's hard to know where
                            time should be spent in future.</p>
                        <p>Whether you have an idea for a new feature or have spotted
                            a potential bug, please let me know.</p>
                        <p>To leave feedback, please <a href="index.php">login</a>
